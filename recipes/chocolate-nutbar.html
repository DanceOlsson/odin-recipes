    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ dl mixed nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts), roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 dl oats</li>
        <li>0.6 dl honey or maple syrup</li>
        <li>4 scoops vanilla protein powder (about 60 g)</li>
        <li>0.6 dl dark chocolate chunks or chips</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chia seeds or flaxseeds (for extra crunch and binding)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coconut oil, melted</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt (plus more for sprinkling)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F) and line a baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped nuts, oats, honey or maple syrup, vanilla protein powder, dark chocolate chunks, chia seeds (or flaxseeds), melted coconut oil, and sea salt. Stir until everything is well mixed.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture firmly into the prepared baking dish, creating an even layer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a little extra sea salt on top for a salty finish.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 15–18 minutes, or until the edges are golden and the mixture is set.</li>
        <li>Allow the bars to cool completely before slicing. This will help them hold together and enhance the chewy-crispy texture.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy these indulgent yet healthy bars with the perfect blend of crunch, chewiness, chocolate, and sea salt!</p>
